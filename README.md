### Requests guided by the constellations

![Polaris](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Night_Photography.jpg/960px-Night_Photography.jpg)

Routing defined by data, not macros.

Also, provides reverse routing for building urls from parameters!

## Installation

#### Leiningen

    [polaris "0.0.15"]

## Usage

Polaris uses a data-driven routing defintion approach.  Routes are given as a
vector of route definitions.  Every route definition has the following form:

```clj
["/path/to/match" :identifying-key handler-fn [optional-child-routes]]
```

Variables in paths can be specified with a `:keyword`:

```clj
["/path/with/:variable" :identifying-key handler-fn [optional-child-routes]]
```

Once you have a vector of route definitions, you can build your routes with `polaris.core/build-routes`:

```clj
(defn base-handler
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "This is the base"})

(defn sub-handler
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body (str "We received " (-> request :params :leaf))})

(def route-definitions
  [["/base-path" :base base-handler
    [["/sub-path/:leaf" :sub sub-handler]]]])

(def routes (polaris.core/build-routes route-definitions))
```

Once you have some routes, you can match requests!

```clj
(def handler (polaris.core/router routes))
(handler {:uri "/base-path"}) ;; ---> {:status 200 :body "This is the base"}
```

Child routes inherit their path from their parent, so for the above routes the
following request would work:

```clj
(handler {:uri "/base-path/sub-path/yellow"}) ;; ---> {:status 200 :body "We received yellow"}
```

Route matching works with or without following slashes:

```clj
(handler {:uri "/base-path/sub-path/chartreuse/"}) ;; ---> {:status 200 :body "We received chartreuse"}
```

Handlers can be scoped to different request methods:

```clj
(defn get-handler
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "The method defaults to GET"})

(defn post-handler
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "This is a POST"})

(defn delete-handler
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "DELETED!!"})

(def route-definitions
  [["/method-sensitive" :base {:GET base-handler :POST post-handler :DELETE delete-handler}]])

(def routes (polaris.core/build-routes route-definitions))
(def handler (polaris.core/router routes))

(handler {:uri "/method-sensitive"}) ;; ---> {:status 200 :body "The method defaults to GET"}
(handler {:uri "/method-sensitive" :request-method :post}) ;; --> {:status 200 :body "This is a POST"}
(handler {:uri "/method-sensitive" :request-method :delete}) ;; --> {:status 200 :body "DELETED!!"}
```

### Subtree Middleware

You can define middleware for a path and all subpaths relative to that path (the **subtree**).  Because middleware forms a stack around the original handler, there are two different ways to add it to the three:  **float** and **sink**.  If you **float** the middleware, it will compose itself at the outermost layer of middleware currently defined for that handler.  Since each path can inherit middleware from paths above it, this stack can grow arbitrarily deep.  If you **sink** the middleware, it will go to the bottom of this stack (ie. run right before the handler).  If deeper down another middleware is sunk, it will go inside even this one.  

```clj
(defn ocean-rock
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "An ocean rock"})

(defn sea-floor
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "A sandy sea floor"})

(defn anemone
  [app]
  (fn [request]
    (update-in (app request) [:body] #(str % " covered in anemone"))))

(defn boat
  [app]
  (fn [request]
    (update-in (app request) [:body] #(str % " underneath a small boat"))))

(def sea-routes
  [["/ocean" :ocean {:ALL ocean-rock :sink anemone :float boat}
    [["/floor" :floor sea-floor]]]])

(def routes (polaris.core/build-routes sea-routes))
(def handler (polaris.core/router routes))

(handler {:uri "/ocean"}) ;; ---> {:status 200 :body "An ocean rock covered in anemone underneath a small boat"}
(handler {:uri "/ocean/floor"}) ;; ---> {:status 200 :body "A sandy sea floor covered in anemone underneath a small boat"}
```

### Reverse Routing

Polaris supports reverse routing, which means you can reconstruct a url based on
the route's identifying key and a map of values to substitute into any variable
path elements.

```clj
(def route-definitions
  [["/path/:with/:lots/:of/:variables" :demo (fn [request] "WHAT")]])

(def routes (polaris.core/build-routes route-definitions))
(polaris.core/reverse-route routes :demo {:with "now" :lots "formed" :of "from" :variables "map"})
;; --> "/path/now/formed/from/map"   !!
```
